**A hands-on course for anyone curious about AI assistants.**

## Why This Exists

There's too much hype about AI and not enough honest demonstration. Most people haven't tried these tools — not because they're resistant, but because nobody showed them what AI assistants actually do in practical, everyday terms.

This course fixes that. Six exercises, each 10–20 minutes, each built around a real task: writing an email, planning meals, organizing messy notes, thinking through a decision. You open your AI assistant, follow the exercise, and judge the results for yourself.

## What Makes This Different

- **Hands-on, not theoretical.** Every module is a practical exercise, not a lecture.
- **Platform-agnostic.** Every exercise includes side-by-side instructions for Claude, ChatGPT, and Google Gemini.
- **Honest about limitations.** The course teaches you how to use AI well *and* how to spot when it's wrong.
- **No tracking, no cookies.** This is a static site. The exercises happen in your own AI assistant account.

## Modules

| | Module | Time |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Before You Start — pick a platform, configure privacy | 5 min |
| 1 | Your First Conversation — meal planning and grocery lists | 10 min |
| 2 | The Email You've Been Putting Off — drafting difficult messages | 10 min |
| 3 | Learn Something New — get a tailored explanation of any topic | 15 min |
| 4 | Tame the Chaos — turn messy notes into structured documents | 15 min |
| 5 | Think It Through — use AI as a thinking partner for decisions | 15 min |
| 6 | Level Up — advanced techniques and iteration strategies | 20 min |

Total: about 90 minutes. Each module stands alone.

## A Note About Free vs. Paid Tiers

Free accounts will get you through the exercises, but free tiers run older models with tighter limits. Judging AI from a free tier is like judging smartphones by using a flip phone. If you're investing 90 minutes to learn what these tools can do, the $20 for one month of a paid plan is worth it. The difference in quality is not subtle.
