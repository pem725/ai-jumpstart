## Who Made This

This course was built by a person who uses AI tools daily and got tired of watching friends and family miss out on capabilities they'd find genuinely useful — not because they're resistant, but because nobody showed them what these tools actually do in practical, everyday terms.

The content was designed with help from AI (because of course it was), then edited by a human who cares about getting it right.

## Philosophy

There's too much hype about AI and not enough honest demonstration. This course takes a simple approach: here's a tool, here's a task, try it, judge the result yourself.

If you finish this course and decide AI assistants aren't for you, that's a perfectly valid conclusion. The goal isn't to convert anyone. It's to give you enough firsthand experience to form an informed opinion.

## Feedback

If something in this course doesn't work, is confusing, or could be better — say so. The best improvements come from people who try the exercises and tell us what didn't land.

## Privacy

This is a static website. It doesn't track you, collect data, or use cookies. The exercises happen in your own AI assistant account, not here.

## License

This course is free to use, share, and adapt. If you share it, just point people back to the original so they get any updates.
