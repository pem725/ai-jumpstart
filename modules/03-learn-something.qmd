## What You'll Practice

- Asking the AI to teach you something at your level
- Using what you already know as a bridge to new concepts
- Getting a hands-on exercise to reinforce what you learned

## Why Learning?

We all have a list of things we've been meaning to understand better. Maybe it's a skill for work, a topic your kid asked about, or something you read about and wanted to dig into. The problem isn't motivation — it's that most explanations are either too basic (you already know that part) or too advanced (you're lost by sentence three).

AI assistants are good at calibrating explanations because you can tell them exactly where you're starting from. They adjust in real time, and they never make you feel slow for asking a follow-up question.

## The Exercise

### Part 1: Pick Your Topic

Choose something you've genuinely been curious about. It can be anything — a skill, a concept, a subject area. Here are some ideas if nothing comes to mind:

- How does a mortgage amortization schedule work?
- What is the basics of how a car engine works?
- How does my Wi-Fi router actually move data around?
- What are the basics of investing in index funds?
- How does bread rise? (The science, not the recipe.)
- What's the difference between a virus and a bacterial infection?

Got your topic? Good. Paste this into a new conversation:

::: {.prompt-box}
I want to understand <span class="placeholder">[your topic]</span>.

Here's where I'm starting from: <span class="placeholder">[what you already know — e.g., "I know the basics of how loans work but I've never understood what amortization actually means" or "I know nothing about this"]</span>.

My background is <span class="placeholder">[e.g., "I'm a teacher," "I work in sales," "I'm a stay-at-home parent," "I'm a student"]</span> — use that to pick analogies and examples that connect to things I already know.

Explain it clearly. No jargon unless you define it first. If there's a key concept I need to understand before the rest makes sense, start there.
:::

::: {.notice-box}
Look at how it structured the explanation. Did it start with the foundational concept? Did the analogies connect to your background? If you told it you're a teacher, it might use classroom analogies. If you're in sales, it might frame things in terms of deals and negotiations. That's not a parlor trick — it's the AI using your context to make the explanation stick.
:::

### Part 2: Go Deeper on the Part That Interests You

Find the part of the explanation that made you want to know more. Send a follow-up:

::: {.followup-box}
That section about <span class="placeholder">[specific part]</span> — I want to go deeper there. Why does that work that way? Give me a concrete example.
:::

::: {.notice-box}
You're steering the conversation now. It didn't decide what's interesting to you — you did. This is the difference between reading an article (fixed path) and having a tutor (flexible path). You go where your curiosity leads.
:::

### Part 3: Make It Hands-On

Ask for something you can actually do:

::: {.followup-box}
Give me a short hands-on exercise I can do in 10–15 minutes to practice or test what I just learned. Use things I'd have at home or can find easily online.
:::

::: {.notice-box}
The exercise it gives you might be surprisingly practical. For a finance topic, it might have you build a simple spreadsheet. For a science concept, it might suggest a kitchen experiment. For a technical skill, a small practice task. This is where learning transitions from "I read about it" to "I tried it."
:::

## A Note About Accuracy

AI assistants are good at explaining concepts clearly, but they can occasionally get details wrong — especially with very specific numbers, dates, or cutting-edge research. For learning purposes, they're excellent as a *starting point* and a *thinking partner*. For anything you'd stake a decision on, verify the key facts with a reliable source.

If something in the explanation doesn't sound right to you, say so: *"That doesn't match what I've heard about [X] — can you double-check?"* The AI will often catch its own mistakes when prompted.

## Evaluate Honestly

- Did the explanation make more sense than what you'd find from a typical web search?
- Did the analogies actually connect to your experience?
- Was the hands-on exercise something you could realistically do?
- What would you want explained differently?

::: {.try-it}
**Bonus — Explain it to a kid:** If you have children or nieces/nephews, try this: *"Now explain [same topic] to a [age]-year-old. Use language they'd understand and suggest a fun activity we could do together to explore it."* It's a great way to see the AI shift gears dramatically — and the activities are often genuinely good.
