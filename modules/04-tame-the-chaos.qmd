## What You'll Practice

- Feeding the AI rough, unstructured content and getting organized output
- Directing revisions like an editor: "more here, less there"
- Keeping your voice in a document someone else (sort of) wrote

## Why Document Writing?

Everyone has a version of this problem: you know what you want to say, but the notes are scattered across sticky notes, a notebook, a few bullet points on your phone, and your head. Turning that into something structured and coherent takes time. Lots of time.

AI assistants are remarkably good at imposing structure on chaos. You pour in the raw material, and they organize it. Then you direct: expand this section, cut that one, change the tone here. You're the editor, not the typist.

## The Exercise

### Part 1: Dump Your Notes

You'll need some rough notes for this exercise. You can use your own, or use the sample below.

**If you have real notes:** Pull up any set of messy notes — bullet points from a meeting, a rough outline for a project, notes from a phone call, ideas for something you're planning. They don't need to be polished. The messier, the better.

**If you want a sample to practice with:**

> Here are some rough notes to use:
>
> - PTA fundraiser needs to happen before end of April
> - Last year raised $4,200 with the bake sale but it was a ton of work
> - Maybe do something different this year? Silent auction? Fun run?
> - Need minimum 6 volunteers, ideally 10
> - Budget for supplies: probably $200-300 from PTA account
> - Principal wants to tie it to the school's reading initiative somehow
> - We should promote it at least 3 weeks in advance
> - Food trucks instead of bake sale? Less liability
> - Venue: school gym or outside if weather is good
> - Need to pick a date — avoid conflict with spring sports schedule
> - Someone suggested a "read-a-thon" where kids get sponsors per book/chapter
> - That could tie into the reading thing and also be low-cost to run

Paste this into a new conversation:

::: {.prompt-box}
Here are my rough notes for <span class="placeholder">[what the document is — e.g., "a proposal to the PTA board," "a project plan for my team," "a summary of my meeting with a client"]</span>. Turn this into a structured document with an introduction, clear sections, and a summary or next-steps section. Keep my voice — don't make it sound overly formal or corporate.

Here are the notes:

<span class="placeholder">[paste your notes here]</span>
:::

::: {.notice-box}
Look at what it did with your raw input. It found a logical structure — probably grouping related ideas, identifying the main themes, and ordering things in a way that flows. Your notes were ingredients. The AI made a meal.
:::

### Part 2: Edit Like a Director

Read through the draft. Find something you want to change. Send a targeted revision:

::: {.followup-box}
The section on <span class="placeholder">[topic]</span> is too vague. Add more detail there — specifically <span class="placeholder">[what's missing]</span>. Also, the introduction is too long. Cut it to 2-3 sentences.
:::

Try another:

::: {.followup-box}
Move the section about <span class="placeholder">[topic]</span> earlier in the document — it should come before <span class="placeholder">[other topic]</span> because <span class="placeholder">[reason]</span>.
:::

::: {.notice-box}
You're not writing. You're directing. "More here. Less there. Reorder this." That's a fundamentally different (and faster) way to produce a document. The thinking is still yours — the formatting and prose work is offloaded.
:::

### Part 3: Polish the Tone

Now fine-tune how it reads:

::: {.followup-box}
The tone is too <span class="placeholder">[stiff / casual / wordy / dry]</span> for my audience. This is going to <span class="placeholder">[who will read it — e.g., "a volunteer committee who are parents, not corporate people"]</span>. Make it sound like a smart, organized person wrote it — not a robot and not a CEO.
:::

::: {.notice-box}
Tone is the hardest thing to get right in writing. The AI's first draft often defaults to a neutral-formal voice. Telling it who the audience is and what feel you want makes a big difference. If it's still off, be more specific: "Write it the way I'd explain this to a friend who asked what I've been working on."
:::

## Getting the Document Out

Once you're happy with the content, you probably want to use it somewhere. Here's how, depending on your platform:

::: {.platform-claude}
Claude can create actual downloadable files — Word documents, PDFs, and more. Say: *"Turn this into a Word document I can download."* A download link will appear in the conversation.
:::

::: {.platform-chatgpt}
ChatGPT can open a side panel called **Canvas** for collaborative editing. Say *"Open this in Canvas"* and you can edit specific sections directly. You can also say *"Create a document I can download."*
:::

::: {.platform-gemini}
Gemini integrates with Google Workspace. Say *"Export this to Google Docs"* if you're using a Google account, or simply copy the text from the conversation.
:::

## Evaluate Honestly

- Did the structure make sense for your content?
- How much of the draft would you keep as-is vs. rewrite?
- Did the editing process (revisions via conversation) feel faster than writing from scratch?
- Did it capture your voice, or did it sound like someone else?

::: {.try-it}
**Go further if you want:** Take any document you've already written — an email, a report, a plan — and paste it in with this prompt: *"Review this document for clarity and organization. What could be structured better? What's unclear? Don't rewrite it — just give me specific feedback."* Using the AI as an editor instead of a writer is a different and equally useful skill.
