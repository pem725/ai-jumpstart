## What This Is

This is a short, self-paced course that teaches you how to use AI assistants through hands-on practice. No lectures. No theory. You open a tool, type a prompt, and see what happens.

You'll work with whichever AI assistant you prefer — **Claude**, **ChatGPT**, or **Google Gemini**. Every exercise includes instructions for all three.

## What This Is Not

This is not a sales pitch for AI. Some of these exercises will impress you. Some won't. The point is for you to see what these tools can actually do *right now* so you can decide for yourself whether they're useful to you.

AI assistants get things wrong sometimes. They make stuff up occasionally. They're tools with real limitations. This course will show you how to use them well *and* how to spot when they're off.

## How the Course Works

Six modules. Each one is a self-contained exercise you can finish in 10–20 minutes. Do them in order or skip to whatever interests you — but **start with "Before You Start"** to get your tool set up.

## Total Time: About 90 Minutes

You don't need to do it all at once. Each module stands alone. But the course is designed so that each one builds a little on the skills you practiced in the last.

## What You'll Need

- A computer or phone with a web browser
- An account on one (or more) of these platforms:
  - [Claude](https://claude.ai) — by Anthropic
  - [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) — by OpenAI
  - [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) — by Google
- About 10–20 minutes per module
- Willingness to try something and see what happens

Free accounts will technically get you through every exercise. But here's the honest truth: free tiers run older, smaller models with shorter limits. Judging AI from a free tier is like judging smartphones by using a flip phone — you'll see *something*, but you'll miss what actually makes the technology useful. If you're investing 90 minutes to learn what AI can do, spend the $20 for one month of a paid plan. You can cancel anytime. The difference in quality is not subtle.
