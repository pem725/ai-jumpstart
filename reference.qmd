## Platform Comparison

All three platforms offer free tiers, but the paid plans ($20/month each) are where the real capability lives — current flagship models, longer context windows, and features like deep research and file creation. If you're serious about seeing what AI can actually do, the paid tier is the starting line, not the upgrade.

## Prompting Cheat Sheet

### Start Strong

Bad: *"Help me with a thing."*

Good: *"I need to [specific task]. Here's the context: [details]. The audience is [who]. I want the tone to be [how]. Keep it under [length]."*

The more specific your request, the better the output. Details aren't optional — they're the difference between generic and useful.

### Useful Follow-up Patterns

| What you want | What to say |
|---|---|
| Shorter | "Cut this in half. Keep only the essential points." |
| More specific | "The section on [X] is too vague. Add concrete examples." |
| Different tone | "Rewrite this for [audience]. It should sound [tone]." |
| Reorganized | "Move [section] before [section]. The current order doesn't flow." |
| Simplified | "A smart 12-year-old should understand this. Rewrite accordingly." |
| More critical | "What's wrong with this? What am I missing? Be honest." |
| Different angle | "Now argue the opposite position with the same rigor." |
| Self-check | "Review what you just wrote for errors, gaps, and weak reasoning." |

### Role-Setting Phrases

Telling the AI to respond from a specific perspective changes what it prioritizes:

- *"You are an experienced [role]..."*
- *"Respond as if you're a [role] advising a client..."*
- *"Think about this from the perspective of a [role]..."*

### When the Output Isn't Good

Don't accept mediocre results. Push back:

- *"That's too generic. Be more specific to my situation."*
- *"You're over-explaining. I already know [X]. Skip to the part I don't know."*
- *"This doesn't sound like me. Here's how I'd actually say it: [example]."*
- *"That fact doesn't sound right. Can you verify it?"*
- *"Start over with a different approach. That angle isn't working."*

## What AI Is Good At (and Not)

### Strong

- Drafting and editing text (emails, reports, documents)
- Explaining and teaching concepts at any level
- Brainstorming ideas and options
- Organizing messy information into structure
- Analyzing tradeoffs and decisions
- Summarizing long documents
- Translating between audiences (technical to non-technical, etc.)
- Writing and explaining code

### Weaker

- Precise math beyond basic arithmetic (it can get calculations wrong)
- Very recent events (web search helps, but verify)
- Highly specialized or niche professional knowledge (it's broad, not always deep)
- Predictions and forecasts (it doesn't know the future)
- Anything requiring access to your personal systems or accounts

### Needs Caution

- Factual claims (verify anything you'll act on)
- Legal, medical, or financial advice (use as a starting point, not a final answer)
- Sensitive personal information (don't share what you wouldn't want stored)
